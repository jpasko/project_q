<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>
  Like most website operators, Pasko Enterprises collects non-personally-identifying information
  of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
  browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
  visitor request. Pasko Enterprises' purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
  information is to better understand how Pasko Enterprises' visitors use its website.
  From time to time, Pasko Enterprises may release non-personally-identifying information
  in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>
  Pasko Enterprises also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
  Protocol (IP) addresses. Pasko Enterprises does not use such information to identify its
  visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the
  same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information,
  as described below.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>
  Certain visitors to Pasko Enterprises’ websites choose to interact with Pasko Enterprises in
  ways that require Pasko Enterprises to gather personally-identifying information. The amount
  and type of information that Pasko Enterprises gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
  Those who engage
  in transactions with Pasko Enterprises are asked to provide additional information, including
  as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions.
  In each case, Pasko Enterprises collects such information only insofar as is necessary
  or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Pasko Enterprises.
  Pasko Enterprises does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
  below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information,
  with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related
  activities.</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>
  Pasko Enterprises may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites.
  For instance, Pasko Enterprises may monitor the most popular portfolios on the folio24.com
  site. Pasko Enterprises
  may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Pasko Enterprises
  does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>
  Pasko Enterprises discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
  information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations
  that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Pasko Enterprises’ behalf
  or to provide services available at Pasko Enterprises’ websites, and (ii) that have agreed
  not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
  organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Pasko Enterprises’
  websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Pasko Enterprises will
  not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
  to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
  as described above, Pasko Enterprises discloses potentially personally-identifying and
  personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Pasko Enterprises
  believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property
  or rights of Pasko Enterprises, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered
  user of an Pasko Enterprises website and have supplied your email address, Pasko Enterprises may
  occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback,
  or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Pasko Enterprises and our products.
  We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information,
  so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for
  example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the
  right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to
  help us support other users. Pasko Enterprises takes all measures reasonably necessary
  to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
